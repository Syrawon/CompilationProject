## Introduction

*English*  

This is a project aiming to compile an [object oriented language](https://github.com/Syrawon/CompilationProject/blob/master/test/ex1.txt) using a lexer, an abstract syntax tree and a code generator/interpretor.

This project has been made with a team of 4 over the course of two months for the Compilation class by Mr Frederic VOISIN.
